# To-Do-List-App
The To‑Do List Application is a simple, console‑based task manager built in Python.

This application allows users to:

-> View existing tasks

-> Add new tasks

-> Remove completed tasks

All tasks are stored in a text file (todo.txt) to ensure persistence between sessions.

## Screenshots of the Application.
